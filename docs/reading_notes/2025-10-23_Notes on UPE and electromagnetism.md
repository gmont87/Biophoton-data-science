UPE signals: UPE are released through the process of oxidation, for example, mitochondrial or myelin production of ROS.
The exact cellular state is encoded in the intensitiy of the UPE.

Inverse square law at the nanoscale increase UPE intensity locally and this improves the signal-to-noise ratio within the cell.
- At 1 nm, UPE intensity is ~8x10^-7 W/cm^2
- Background noise such as regular thermal noise at 37C or other biophotons, is ~10^-20 W/cm^2 at the cellular scale, which gives a high S/N ratio:
- S/N = (8x10^-7)/(10^-20)= 8x10^13
- > this high S?N allows UPEs to transmit info reliably at the nanoscale level despite there globally weak intensity.
- UPEs span a broad spectrum of(300-700 nm) therefore, since f = c/(wavelength), their corresponding frequencies range from 430 - 1000 THz. This is the bandwidth of the UPE and even if only part of it is used (e.g. 1THz) the channel capacity is significant due to the high S/N 

Photons are both carriers of information and sources of energy.
- Color specific roles:
    - Purple = ignition
    - Blue = tuning (disruptive in excess)
    - Green = stabilises Hb
    - Yellow/amber = synchronise clocks
    - Red = photorepair
    - All need to be in unison

“In quantum terms, periodicity functions as an entropy flow meter, sensed by molecular clocks to maintain low-entropy states.  Artificial narrow-spectrum LEDs impair this cycle, yielding incomplete repair and elevated entropy, whereas full-spectrum sunlight sustains it, promoting health as a minimized entropy state.”

Periodicity
- Electromagnetic radiation consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and propagate through space at the speed of light.
    - Wavelength is spatial periodicity, distance between consecutive peaks.
    - Temporal periodicity (Period and Frequency) This is the time it takes to complete a cycle to pass a fixed point is the period (T). The inverse of the period is the frequency (v or f), which is the number of wave cycles that pass a point per second ( Hertz, Hz)
    -  These concepts are connected by the speed of light
        - C = wavelength x frequency
    - The energy (E) of a single photon (quantum of light) is directly proportional to its frequency:
        - E = h x v 
        - H is Planck’s constant
        - SO higher frequency light carry more energy per photon
    - Periodicity of light determines how it will interact with the periodi properties of elements in the periodic table.
        - Atoms and molecules can only absorb or emit photons with specific, discrete energies (and therefore specific frequency/periodicity) that match the energy differences between their allowed quantum energy levels.
        - Basis of spectroscopy, the pattern of these frequencies is a direct result of the quantum mechanical, periodic structure of the electron shells in an atom.
    - In applied electromagnetism and solid-state physics: Periodic structures are designed such as, diffraction gratings, photonic crystals, and antennas, that manipulate the propagation of light and the EM waves. 
        - These human-made periodic patterns interact with the inherent periodicity of EM waves in predictable ways that lead to phenomena such as constructive and destructive interference and creation of “band gaps” that block certain light frequencies.
    - Photonic crystals: sculpt light at the nano scale.
        - Structures designed to manipulate light by creating periodic variation in the materials refractive index (or dielectric constant). Typically on the scale of the wavelength of light intended to control.
        - ‘Photonic Band Gap’ a range of frequencies that are forbidden from propagating through the material, irrespective of direction.
        - Can be 1, 2, or 3D
        - Can confine of guide light.
    - Antennas: Radiate and capture EM waves at a larger scale
        - Resonance: The physical size of the antenna is specifically matched to the wavelength ( and therefore frequency/periodicity) of the electric signal it handles.
        - Antenna arrays: to achieve higher directionality and steer beams, multiple elements can arranged in a periodic array. The phase relationship (timing) between signals in each element is precisely controlled that the radiated waves interfere constructively in a desired direction and destructively elsewhere.
