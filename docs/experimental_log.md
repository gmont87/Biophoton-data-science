### 2025-10-23 â€” Initial Setup Planning

**Objective:**  
Define experimental goals, finalize sensor selection, and sketch physical setup.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Review materials list (camera, photodiode, LED reference light, etc.)  
- [ ] Design experimental layout sketch  
- [ ] Decide control vs. test sample conditions  
- [ ] Plan Python data pipeline (input â†’ processing â†’ visualization)

**Notes:**  
_(Example: Decided to use basil and marigold for initial trials due to strong luminescence response in literature.)_

### 2025-10-24 â€” Materials & Light Isolation Tests

**Objective:**  
Ensure dark chamber provides complete light isolation.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Assemble cardboard/wood box prototype  
- [ ] Add blackout fabric or foil seams  
- [ ] Test internal darkness using long-exposure photo  
- [ ] Document setup with photo (store image in `/docs/images/`)

**Observations:**  
_(Example: Residual light leak from corner seam; adding foam gasket tomorrow.)_

### 2025-10-25 â€” Sensor Calibration

**Objective:**  
Calibrate sensitivity using a known light source.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Use LED at known distance/intensity  
- [ ] Record sensor output for 10s  
- [ ] Create calibration curve in Python  
- [ ] Store code snippet link

**Code Reference:**  
[`code_snippets/2025-10-25_sensor_calibration.py`](../code_snippets/2025-10-25_sensor_calibration.py)

**Results:**  
| LED Intensity | Sensor Value | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Low | 0.02 | minimal detection |
| Medium | 0.15 | steady response |
| High | 0.92 | near saturation |

### 2025-11-01 â€” First Data Capture Session

**Objective:**  
Record spontaneous photon emission from plant tissue in dark chamber.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Capture 10-minute dark response  
- [ ] Repeat for control (non-living sample)  
- [ ] Export raw data as `.csv`  
- [ ] Visualize using pandas + matplotlib  

**Code Reference:**  
[`code_snippets/2025-11-01_photon_analysis.py`](../code_snippets/2025-11-01_photon_analysis.py)

### 2025-11-02 â€” Data Review & Python Analysis

**Objective:**  
Compare photon emission time series and create plots.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Plot emission intensity vs. time  
- [ ] Perform smoothing using rolling average  
- [ ] Identify emission spikes and correlations  
- [ ] Summarize findings in notes  

**Visualization Example:**  
(Insert matplotlib graph once results are available.)

**Insights:**  
_(Example: Plant sample showed exponential decay curve consistent with delayed luminescence models.)_
