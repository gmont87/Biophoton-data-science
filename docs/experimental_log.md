### 2025-10-23 ‚Äî Initial Setup Planning

**Objective:**  
Define experimental goals, finalize sensor selection, and sketch physical setup.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Review materials list (camera, photodiode, LED reference light, etc.)  
- [ ] Design experimental layout sketch  
- [ ] Decide control vs. test sample conditions  
- [ ] Plan Python data pipeline (input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí visualization)

**Notes:**  
## The Budget Biophoton Experiment Setup

This setup uses a combination of a used integrated PMT module and a general-purpose, used frequency counter.

### üîç Explanation of Components

**PMT Module:**  
The integrated Hamamatsu modules (H10721-01 or H6357-11) are key to minimizing setup complexity.  
They provide a ready-to-use output signal (TTL-level pulses) directly from a BNC connector, so you do not have to handle high voltage or design complex preamplifier circuits yourself.

**Frequency Counter:**  
A dedicated, used frequency counter is more reliable and faster than an Arduino for single-photon counting.  
It has a high-speed input (MHz range) capable of accurately counting the rapid pulses produced by the PMT.

**Power Supply:**  
The PMT module needs a standard low-voltage DC supply, which is inexpensive and safe to use.

**Dark Box:**  
Biophoton emission is extremely weak. Any ambient light will completely saturate the PMT.  
The enclosure must be completely sealed from light.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

**1. Safety First:**  
Although the high voltage is contained within the integrated PMT module, treat all equipment with care.  
Ensure all connections are secure before applying power.

**2. Mount the PMT and Sample in the Dark Box:**  
- Securely mount the PMT module inside the light-tight enclosure.  
- Design a holder for your biophoton sample (e.g., germinating seeds or fruit pulp) so it is close to the PMT‚Äôs photocathode window but not touching it.  
- Ensure the box lid creates an absolute light seal. You may need foam weather stripping or black tape.  

**3. Connect the Power:**  
Connect the low-voltage DC power supply to the PMT module‚Äôs power input (check the datasheet for correct voltage and polarity, usually +12V or +15V).

**4. Connect the Counter:**  
Use a BNC cable to connect the PMT module‚Äôs signal output to the input channel of the frequency counter.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Operation

1. Close the dark box completely.  
2. Turn on the PMT power supply.  
3. Turn on the frequency counter and set it to a suitable gate time (e.g., 1 second).  
4. Record the **dark count rate** with no sample inside the sealed box. This is your baseline noise level.  
5. Place your sample inside the sealed box and measure the new count rate.  
6. The difference between the sample count rate and the dark count rate is your **biophoton signal**.
